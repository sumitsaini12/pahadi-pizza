## Logo/Favicon Files

To add your logo as the favicon (icon in browser tab), add the following files here:

1. **favicon.ico** - Main favicon (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
   - This will appear in the browser tab
   - Recommended size: 32x32 or 48x48 pixels

2. **apple-touch-icon.png** (Optional) - For iOS devices
   - Recommended size: 180x180 pixels

## File Naming

- `favicon.ico` - Main favicon
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - Apple touch icon (optional)

## How to Add

1. Place your logo image file(s) in this folder
2. Make sure the file names match exactly:
   - `favicon.ico` for the main icon
   - `apple-touch-icon.png` for Apple devices (optional)

The favicon will automatically appear in the browser tab once you add the file and restart your development server.
